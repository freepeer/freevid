A peer-to-peer audio/video social network to rival youtube, facebook and other corporate kleptocrats of free thought

We're looking for volunteers and interested parties to discuss, plan and work on a peer-to-peer network that:
- allows content-creators to distribute content freely
- allows consumers to comment freely
- allows consumers to rate and categorize content and other comments with specificity such that when such ratings and categorizations are aggregated will allow consumers to sort content and comments to their liking
- allows consumers to curate their own public profile where they may post content as they see fit and well-understand will be public
- allows consumers and content-creators to publish anonymously
- uses browser-finger-printing and other strategies to publicly identify and link accounts created by the same original user in order to reduce spamming or falsely influencing ratings
